# Engineering Drawings

All drawings are created in [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) format (`.drawio`).

## Files

### Pages in BrewController_Drawings.drawio

1. **Interior Panel Layout** (PNL-001 Rev B) — DIN rail component layout with I/O assignment table
2. **Operator Face Panel** (PNL-002 Rev B) — Front view with DI mapping
3. **System Architecture** (SYS-001 Rev A) — Signal flow from field instruments through PLC to HMI

## Scale & Conventions

- Interior layout uses **28 pts = 1 inch** scale
- Uses the `mxgraph.cabinets` shape library for DIN rail, terminal blocks, breakers, contactors
- Color-coded terminal blocks match physical build (green, blue, orange, red)
