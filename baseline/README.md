# Baseline System Artifacts

Original system files for reference during migration.

## CCW Project

The `ccw-project/` directory contains the Connected Components Workbench project export (`Hannan_BrewControllerV5_1`). This is the original PLC source — FBD programs in proprietary format.

**Note:** CCW is required to open/edit these files. The extracted analysis in `/docs/ccw-analysis/` is the human/AI-readable version.

## Ignition

The `ignition/` directory will contain the Ignition project backup (gateway export) including:
- HMI screens
- Tag configuration
- Modbus TCP driver settings
- Alarm configuration
